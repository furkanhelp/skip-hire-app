# Skip Hire App – "Choose Your Skip Size" Redesign

This project is a front-end implementation of the **"Choose Your Skip Size"** page for REMWaste, built entirely from scratch using **React**, **JavaScript**, and **TailwindCSS**. It was created as part of a technical challenge for a job application.

## 💡 My Approach

My goal was to design and build a clean, user-friendly interface that makes it easy for customers to choose the right skip for their needs. I focused on clarity, simplicity, and responsive layout without relying on external UI libraries or frameworks.

Rather than over-engineering the solution, I prioritized a lean, intuitive design that could be easily extended in the future. Every component was handcrafted to reflect an understanding of both user experience and clean code structure.

> ✨ “I believe great user experiences are built through simple, thoughtful design — not just fancy components.”

## 🔍 Key Features

- ✅ Fully responsive layout built with Flexbox and Grid
- ✅ Skip cards display size, capacity, and typical use cases
- ✅ Clear call-to-action to help users proceed
- ✅ Clean, readable codebase written in vanilla React (no dependencies)
- ✅ Designed with real users in mind — quick, intuitive, and frictionless

## 🧱 Tech Stack

- **React**
- **TailwindCSS**
- **Next.Js** (for fast development build and preview)

## 🚀 Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/furkanhelp/skip-hire-app.git

• Clean code and modular structure

• Strong grasp of core React fundamentals
